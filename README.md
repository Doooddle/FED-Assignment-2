## Features ##


1. ### Navigation Bar (Javascript)
    - This feature utilizes Javascript.
    - Javascript Implementation (nav.js)
        - Toggles responsive view: On-click, responsive view of navigation bar will slide into frame.
        - Toggles menu: On-click, hamburger menu will be replaced with an 'X', representing close.
        - Blurred screen: Aids users to focus on menu across the various pages.

2. ### Home Page

    - ### Word of the Day Implementation (API & Javascript)

        -  This feature utilizes both API and Javascript. 
        - API Implementation
            -  Utlizes two APIs Heroku Random Word API and Dictionary API. We retrieve a random word from Random Word Api. This word is then used to fetch defintions and the type of word from the Dictionary API.
        - Javascript Implementation (randomword.js)
            - Based on the data retrieved from the APIs it is then displayed on to the page.

    - ### Carousel Implementation (Bootstrap)
        - This feature ultilizes bootstrap.
        - Carousel component in bootstrap creates a carousel to display the featured games section of the homepage
            - Automatic sliding: Every few seconds when the cursor is not on the carousel, it will slide to the next page.
            - Responsive: Carousel will resize itself as page size decreases.

3. ### Games Page

    - ### Typing Game (API & Javascript & Lottie)

        - This feature utlizes API, Javascript and Lottie.
        - API Implementation
            - Utilizes Vercel Random Word API, where we retrieve 50 random words, that are uppercase and alphabetized, adding it to a list, which would be used for the typing game.
        - Javascript Implementation (typinggame.js):
            - Difficulty: Players are given a choice in the difficulty, this is in the form of 15,30,45,60 seconds as the difficulty level. The harder the difficulty, the less the time given.
            - Random word generation: Selected word to be typed in the game is randomzed based on the number of words in the list, in this case 50.
            - Keystroke detection: Tracks player input and highlights matching letters, providing visual feedback and a sense of progress. (span)
            - Scorekeeping: Tracks correctly typed words and displays the player's score, motivating them to improve their performance. A pop up message is shown when the countdown ends.
            - Animated word fading: Adds a visual flourish to the game, making it more visually appealing and rewarding for players.
        - Lottie Animation Implementation (preloader.js)
            - While waiting for the page to load, we utilised a lottie animation that vanishes after 3 seconds.
        - Instructions are added to the game ensuring that users will understand how to play it.


    - ### Hangman Game (Javascript & Lottie & API)

        - This feature utlizes API, Javascript and Lottie.
        - Javascript Implementation (hangman.js)
            - Hangman visuals: Displays an evolving hangman image as players make incorrect guesses, creating a sense of urgency and engagement. If a user inputs a wrong character, a new hangman visual is shown.
            - Word selection: Randomly chooses a word from a list, ensuring a different challenge each time. The words are randomly selected from the hangman-wordlist.js.
            - Hint system: Provides a helpful hint to guide players towards the correct word. The hints are randomly selected from the hangman-wordlist.js.
            - Letter guessing: Allows players to click on keyboard buttons to guess letters. We utilized ASCII to convert the numbers to keys.
            - Guess tracking: Highlights correctly guessed letters within the word and keeps track of wrong guesses. The player is given 6 tries to guess the word, this is displayed on the page.
            - Game over scenarios: Displays a modal with a victory or loss message, along with the correct word, at the end of each game, after 6 wrong tries.
            - Play again option: Offers a convenient button to initiate a new game. The games is then restarted and a new word and hint is shown. The hangman picture changes to the original hangman back.
        - API Implementation (hangman-wordlist.js)
            - The words and hints(defintion) are retrieved from 2 APIs (I only used APIs that are free and did not require a key.) After retrieving a word from the first API, it retrieves the definition from the second API. The code is recursive because sometimes the dictionary API did not have the defintion, therefore had to retrieve again. This is done so until the list has 20 words retrieved from the APIs.
        - Lottie Animation Implementation (preloader.js)
            - While waiting for the page to load, we utilised a lottie animation that vanishes after 3 seconds.
        - Instructions are added to the game ensuring that users will understand how to play it.

    - ### Dictionary (API & Javascript & Lottie)

        - This feature utlizes API, Javascript and Lottie.
        - API Implementation
            - Inputed word is used to retrieve data from the Dictionary API. If the data is available we would retrieve its defintion, sound (how to pronounce the word) and example on how to use the word.
        - Javascript Implementation (dictionary.js)
            - Word search: Allows users to type in a word and view its definition, part of speech, phonetic transcription, and an example sentence.
            - Audio pronunciation: Plays an audio clip of the word's pronunciation (if available from the API).
            - Error handling: Displays an error message if the word is not found or if there's an issue fetching data.
            - User-friendly interface: Presents information in a clear and readable format, with a dedicated button to play pronunciation audio.
        - Lottie Implementation
            - Before page loads, a lottie animation plays for 3 seconds.
        - Instructions are added to the page ensuring that users will understand how to play it.

    - ### Number Guessing Game (Javascript & Lottie)
        - This feature utlizes Javascript and Lottie.
        -Javascript Implementation (numberguessing.js)
            - Random Number Generation: When page is loaded, a random number between 1 and 1000 is chosen randomly.
            - Hint system: Higher or lower message is given when number is inputted.
            - Guess tracking: Each round, the user is given 10 guesses to try to pinpoint the correct answer, if inputted answer is wrong, guessing chance is decreased.
            - Game Over: When answer is inputted correctly or the user runs out of guessing attempts, either a victory or a loss message is shown.
            - Restart button: Restart button is implemented when game is over, 'check' button becomes 'restart' button.
        - Lottie Animation Implementation (preloader.js)
            - While waiting for the page to load, we utilised a lottie animation that vanishes after 3 seconds.
        - Instructions are added to the game ensuring that users will understand how to play it.

4. ### About Page

        - This section explains the reason for the website and why it is set up. It is seperated into 3 sections, with each section having a lottie animaton which would animate when hovered.
    - ### Contact Us Form (API)
        - The user will input name, email and message into the form, The form will then utilize Formspree API to send the data to the Formspree database for the owner to see the information. A pop up message is then shown.

5. ### Login Page

    - ### Login Form (Javascript)
        - The user is able to input their email and password into the form. There is a clickable checkbox if user wants the website to "Remember me". Once user presses Login button, a pop up message is then shown. There is also a clickable "Register" so that the page changes to Registration Form. This is done so by making the wrapper active.
    - ### Register form (Javascript)
        - The user is able to input their username, email and password into the form. There is a clickable checkbox if user wants the website to "Agree to the terms & Conditions". Once user presses Register button, a pop up message is shown. There is also a clickable "Login" so that the page changes to Login Form. This is done so by making the wrapper unactive.

6. ### Responsive Web Design

    - The navigation bar will adjust to a Hamburger Menu, in top down design, when the screen is less than 35rem, making it easier for users to go to other sections.
    - In the Home Page, the 'Featured Games' carousel will resize itself to fit the frame, and descriptive text will be removed to aid visibility

    - In the Games Page, the games will adjust to a top down design, 1 game stacked on each other, instead of 3 side by side each other.
    - In the About Us Section, the 3 sections explaining the about us, will be stacked on top of each other, when the screen become smaller.
